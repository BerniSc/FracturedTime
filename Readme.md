# Digital Prototype of _Fractured Time_

A puzzle-platformer playing with timelines and timecontroll.

Heavily based on [this great assetpack](https://ansimuz.itch.io/sunny-land-pixel-game-art)

# Core Concept

Player can perform regular platforming-sequences, but has to solve puzzles to proceed. To do this the player is able to "perform actions" in a different timeline". He can "branch" of his current time and move forward for _X_-Seconds in a new timeline. All the actions performend in the _X_ Seconds will then be looped back endlessly until the timeline is cleared out.

This mechanic could be used to solve different timingbased puzzles, like pressing multiple switches in different timepatterns enabling access to for example a door, disable traps etc.
Likewise timeline-clones could be used to distract enemies, maybe trigger traps (like bouldertraps a'la Indiana Jones) or even combine forces opening heavy doors etc.
